One of AWS ECR pain points is that you can only have one image per repository.
However, each repository can have multiple versions of the same image.
You will first need to create the repository in ECR, either from the console or from the command line.

The commands in the makefile assumes you have AWS cli properly configured.
Either by having the following environment variables defined: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
Or by having run the _aws configure_ command beforehand.

Two variables have a default value assigned: AWS_REGION and AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER.
The AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER is a 12-digit number.
Please see the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.html) if you need to find out your account number.
